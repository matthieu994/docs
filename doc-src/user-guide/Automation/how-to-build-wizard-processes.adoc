NOTE: Source Code

The source code for this tutorial is available on GitHub at:
https://github.com/openmsa/Workflows-Microservices/tree/master/WORKFLOWS/Tutorials/Process_Wizard

It is possible to design processes with multiple tasks and configure the
process to execute in a wizard-like way, with execution pause to allow
the user to input parameters during the process execution.

The sample Workflow "Process_Wizard" has 2 processes, the main process
"compute" will ask for the user to provide 2 integer values and
calculate the sum of the 2 integers.

In order to configure the task to put the process execution on hold, the
keyword PAUSE should be used as a parameter of prepare_json_response:

....

<?php
/**
 * This file is necessary to include to use all the in-built libraries of /opt/fmc_repository/Reference/Common
 */
require_once
'/opt/fmc_repository/Process/Reference/Common/common.php';
/**
 * List all the parameters required by the task
 */
function list_args() {
  create_var_def('a', 'Integer');
}

/**
 * Use the keyword PAUSE to put the task in a PAUSE state, waiting for the user to click on the
 * continue icon and optionnaly input some parameters
 */

$ret = prepare_json_response(PAUSED, 'Task pause', $context, true);
echo "$ret\n";
?>
....

When a task is paused, it will appear colored in orange in the instance
list screen.

The user must click on continue (the arrow pointing downward) in the
"live console" to open a new dialogue to enter the parameters.
