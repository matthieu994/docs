== Configuration Change Management

The last tab on the device page is called “History”.

It provides information about your hardware, the different versions of
firmware and licences, as well as information on the device
configuration.

=== Asset History Management

The system keeps the history of the assets that were installed on the
device and creates an internal event (prefixed by
"[.confluence-link]#VNOC#") event that can be used to trigger
link:../Assurance/alarm-management{outfilesuffix}[alarms].

The managed assets are defined and discovered by the device adaptor and
can be customized to adapt to the device model or by adding additional
properties.

==== Illustration with a Firewall

The firmware version is v6.0.0.

After the image upgrade to v6.0.1, the firmware inventory shows the
history of the images that were applied.

The alarm management shows the VNOC event raised by the upgrade.

=== Configuration Change Management

The MSActivator maintains all the versions of the running configurations
of the managed devices in its configuration database.

Every time the MSActivator configures a device or detects a
configuration change, it will fetch the current configuration, version
it and store it in its configuration database.

This configuration will be available later to manage configuration
changes.

NOTE: Every night the MSActivator analyses the configuration of all its
managed devices and tracks modifications that may have been done
manually on the device.

The configuration history is available on the Devices page, then going
to the "History" tab and selecting "Change Mgt".

The change management shows the list of all configuration versions that
were archived since the device's
link:../Getting_Started/getting-started-with-the-msactivator{outfilesuffix}[initial
provisioning:]

The user has access to functions such as:

* comparing two versions of the configuration
* downloading a selected configuration version
* showing the details of the configuration, which are:
** the running configuration
** the configuration that was actually applied
** the errors that may have been raised during the configuration
* creating a tag to identify a specific version
* backing up the current running configuration
* rolling back the current configuration to one of the previous
configuration versions

NOTE: Calling the configuration rollback should be done carefully
because it will completely replace the current running configuration of
the device with the rollback version.
In most cases, it also reboots the device.
