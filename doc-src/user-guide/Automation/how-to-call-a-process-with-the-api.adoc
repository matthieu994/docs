Before we deal with how to invoke the processes of Workflows, we need to
attach a Workflow definition to a customer in MSActivator.

First, we will look into how to attach a Workflow definition to a
customer.

[[HowtoCallaProcesswiththeAPI-Pre-requisitesforWorkflowprocess]]
== *Pre-requisites for Workflow process*

If a Workflow needs to be invoked from a portal and REST API in the
command line, the Workflow needs to include some extra code.

Basically, when you invoke the Workflow from the UI Portal, all the
parameters go into the $context. But, when you invoke the Workflow from
the command line using REST APIs, all the input parameters go into the
$parameters. 

Orchestration only considers the parameters set in $context. So, all the
parameters provided through the command line will go into $parameters
and will not be considered for the execution. Rather, previously saved
parameters will be used. 

If someone intends a Workflow to be invoked from both the UI and command
line, the Workflow should have some code which will copy the parameters
from $parameters to $context. Following is the code that has to be in
the first task of the process that will be invoked from an API call:

....


if(isset($parameters) ){
    $context['<param_name_1>'] = $parameters['<param_name_1>'];
    $context['<param_name_2>'] = $parameters['<param_name_2>'];
   ......
   ....
 }

....
[[HowtoCallaProcesswiththeAPI-AttachaWorkflowDefinitiontoaCustomer:]]
== *Attach a Workflow Definition to a Customer:*

[[HowtoCallaProcesswiththeAPI-NorthboundAPI]]
=== North bound API

MSActivator has a northbound API to attach a Workflow definition to a
customer:

....

http://{$MSA_IP}/orchestration/{$ubiqube_id}/service/attach?uri={$service_uri}
HTTP method: POST
....

Where:

{$MSA_IP} corresponds to the IP address of the MSActivator. 

{$ubiqube_id} corresponds to the customer id of the
MSActivator including the prefix, for example UBIA234.

{$service_uri} corresponds to the relative path of the XML file of the
Workflow definition in MSActivator repository. The relative path starts
from "Process/......" and includes the .xml at the end.

[[HowtoCallaProcesswiththeAPI-PHPlibraryfunctionforTasks]]
=== PHP library function for Tasks

The PHP function is available in the MSActivator library of the PHP
methods to consume this API in the file
"Process/Reference/Common/Library/orchestration_rest.php". The method to
use in this file is:
....


_orchestration_service_attach ($ubiqube_id, $service_uri);
....
The $ubiqube_id and $service_uri correspond to the same as explained in
the API.

[[HowtoCallaProcesswiththeAPI-InvokeaCreateProcessofaWorkflow]]
== Invoke a Create Process of a Workflow

[[HowtoCallaProcesswiththeAPI-NorthboundAPI.1]]
=== Northbound API

To call the create process of a Workflow under a customer with the goal
of creating a new instance of the Workflow, the following API is
available:

....
URL: 
http://{$MSA_IP}/ubi-api-rest/orchestration/service/execute/{$external_ref}/{$service_external_ref}?serviceName={$service_name}&processName={$process_name}
HTTP method: POST
....

Where:{$external_ref} corresponds to the MSActivator customer external
reference.

{$service_external_ref} corresponds to the MSActivator Workflow
instance external reference to the newly created instance. Note that it
has to be unique (duplicates are not allowed).{$service_name}
corresponds to the service name/URI which is the relative path of the
Workflow definition, excluding the .xml starting from the "Process/..."
in the fmc_repository.{$process_name} is the process name defined in
the XML definition of the Workflow. FYI the XML definition can be
downloaded from the MSActivator repository web GUI.For input parameters
that are required for the Workflow, the HTTP body has to be a JSON
format string containing a variable: value pairs, for example. If
triggering the create process of a Workflow, it requires following two
variable-value pairs to be instantiated:

* management_ip : 10.30.18.40
* management_interface: Loopback0

The HTTP body to the above API should be as follows:

....
{ "management_ip" : "10.30.18.40", "management_interface": "Loopback0"}
....
This API, if successful, returns a JSON object containing the triggered
process details (like processId and so on), Workflow instance details
(line serviceId, serviceExternalreference etc.), and the status details
of the triggered process. The actual JSON structure can be found in the
example below:

[[HowtoCallaProcesswiththeAPI-Examplewithcurl]]
=== Example with curl

Consider we want to trigger a create process:
"*Process/MSA/FortiHypervisor/Fortinet_Selfcare/Process_Create*"
(process name) of the Workflow:
"*Process/MSA/FortiHypervisor/Fortinet_Selfcare/Fortinet_Selfcare*"
(service name) under a customer with customer external reference:
*MSSA34*. The Worklfow/service instance external reference
string "*My_New_Instance*" provided, will be unique, as long as the
create process needs the following variable-value inputs: 
"admin_customer_ref": "MSAA12" and "device": "test_device".

....

/usr/bin/curl -isw 'HTTP_CODE=%{http_code}' -u 
<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD> --connect-timeout 60 --max-time 60 -H 
"Content-Type: application/json"-X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:80/ubi-api-rest/orchestration/service/execute/MSSA34/My_New_Instance?serviceName=Process/MSS/Selfcare&processName=Process/MSS/Process_Create'-d '{
        "admin_customer_ref": "MSSA12",
        "device": "test_device"
}'
....
<USERNAME> and <PASSWORD> to be replaced with MSActivator user
credentials.

serviceName and processName are in URL encoded form.

*Note*: In this example, "service external reference" (optional) is not
provided, hence it is auto-generated in the format
*<Operator_prefix>SID<Service_Instance_id>* for ex. MSASID6608.

The API response would be:

....

Curl Response :

[[HowtoCallaProcesswiththeAPI-PHPlibraryfunctionforTasks.1]]
=== PHP library function for Tasks

In the MSA, to invoke an API, a library PHP function is available. This
API is defined in this type of file:
"Process/Reference/Common/Library/orchestration_rest.php":

....


_orchestration_execute_service_by_reference ($external_ref, $service_ref, $service_name, $process_name, $json_body = "{}");
....
The parameters are the same as explained in the API above. The
*$json_body* corresponds to the string that is mentioned in the HTTP
body section of the API.

The returned response of the API needs to be assigned to a PHP variable
and then accessed.

[[HowtoCallaProcesswiththeAPI-ExampleofthePHPfunctionusage:]]
==== Example of the PHP function usage:

If the above API example was done using this PHP method, the following
would be the PHP code snippet of the PHP task implementation to trigger
and access the response:

....

$process_name="Process/MSA/Helloworld/Process_create_instance";
$service_name="Process/MSA/Helloworld";
$json_body="{}";
$external_ref="MSSA34";
$response= _orchestration_execute_service_by_reference ($external_ref, "My_New_Instance", $service_name, $process_name, $json_body);

 
//Now the returned info is accessed using the $response variable as shown below:
//Decode the json string into objects
$response = json_decode($response, true);
if ($response['wo_status'] !== ENDED) {
    task_exit(FAILED, "Service $service_name execution failed.\n". $response['wo_comment']);
}
$selfcare_instance_id=$response['wo_newparams']['serviceId']['id'];
//As per the above response, the $selfcare_instance_id would now have the value 6608
$selfcare_instance_ref=$response['wo_newparams']['serviceId']['serviceExternalReference'];
//As per the above response, the $selfcare_instance_ref would now have the value "My_New_Instance"

[[HowtoCallaProcesswiththeAPI-TriggeranUPDATEorDELETEprocessofaWorkflow]]
== Trigger an UPDATE or DELETE process of a Workflow

[[HowtoCallaProcesswiththeAPI-NorthboundAPI.2]]
=== Northbound API

When invoking the UPDATE or DELETE process of a Workflow instance, the
API is the same as for the CREATE.

Curl example:

We wish to trigger an update process
"Process/MSA/FortiHypervisor/Fortinet_Selfcare/Process_Update" (process
name) of the Workflow
"Process/MSA/FortiHypervisor/Fortinet_Selfcare/Fortinet_Selfcare"
(service name). This is for the Workflow instance identified by the
service external reference with the value MSASID6608, which is under a
customer with customer external reference: MSSA34. This is provided that
the create process needs the following variable-value inputs: 

* "name": "John"
* "device": "test_device".

....


/usr/bin/curl -isw 'HTTP_CODE=%{http_code}' -u
