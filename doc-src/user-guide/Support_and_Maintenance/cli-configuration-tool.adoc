== Overview

=== *The MSActivator has 2 configuration interfaces:*:

* a web-based interface, used only for the initial configuration as
explained in
http://confluence.ubiqube.com:14523/display/MSA1711/MSActivator+Installation+and+Configuration+Guide[MSActivator
Installation and Configuration Guide].
* a CLI-based configuration tool, the configurator.

The configurator is available from the MSActivator Linux CLI by
executing the command: /opt/configurator/configure.

=== *Several options are available, here are the most common ones:*:

* --expert: will show all the configuration options available.
* --no-reconf: will not execute the automated configuration of all the
modules of the MSActivator (Web Portal, SecEngine,...).

NOTE: If executed with no option, the user will be prompted to provide
input on 2 options. Entering "n" for both input has the same effect as
--expert and --no-reconf.
