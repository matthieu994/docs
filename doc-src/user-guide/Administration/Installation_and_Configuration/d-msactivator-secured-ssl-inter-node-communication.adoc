= D Msactivator Secured Ssl Inter Node Communication
:imagesdir: ../../resources/
ifdef::env-github,env-browser[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]

== Overview

This page explains the set-up to configure SSL for internal
communication between

* SecEngine and the database
* JBoss application server and the database

This will ensure that inter-node communication is secured in a
Distributed MSActivator setup.

NOTE: The feature is partially available in MSA-17.1.1-1 and requires
some manual steps to be activated.
Starting from MSA-17.1.1-2, the feature can be fully activated with the MSActivator configuration tool.

== How to Activate the Encryption (v17.1.1P02+)

For MSActivator or D-MSActivator running version 17.1.1P02+, the feature
can be activated simply with the CLI-based configuration tool:

....
/opt/configurator/configure --expert
....

Select database configuration and update the configuration below:

....
Database secured communication (SSL) (true)
....

== How to Activate the Encryption (v17.1.1P01)

For MSActivator or D-MSActivator running version 17.1.1P01, the feature
must first be activated with the CLI-based configuration tool:

....
/opt/configurator/configure --expert
....

Select database configuration and update the configuration below:

....
Database secured communication (SSL) (true)
....

For MSActivator or D-MSActivator where the PostgreSql DB nodes are
separated, the configuration of the remote DB nodes must be finalized as
follows.

We assume that the /etc/hosts file allows SSH remote execution on the DB
nodes. For example, if DB nodes are *db-1* and *db-2*:

....
/opt/base/tools/Psql/activatePgsqlSSL.sh  db-1  db-2
....
