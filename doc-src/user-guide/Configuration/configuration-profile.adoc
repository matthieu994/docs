Configuration profiles are a collection
of link:../Configuration/Microservices/microservices{outfilesuffix}[Microservices] and configuration
templates that can be grouped and associated with devices to build a
consistent configuration.

A managed device can only be associated with one configuration profile.

A link:Configuration_Template/configuration-template{outfilesuffix}[configuration
template] and/or a link:../Configuration/Microservices/microservices{outfilesuffix}[Microservices] can
be associated with multiple configuration profiles.
