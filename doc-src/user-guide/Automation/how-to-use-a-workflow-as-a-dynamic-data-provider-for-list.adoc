This tutorial explains how to use the variable type "Workflow Reference"
to act as a dynamic data provider with a list of referenced workflow
instances.

This is useful for calling a process from another process of the same
workflow or another workflow as explained in
link:../Automation/workflow-rest-api-and-function-library{outfilesuffix}[Workflow
REST API and Function Library].

The "data provider" workflow below has 3 instances

These instances can be listed with a variable "workflow reference" to
allow another workflow to use these references and call a process from a
selected instance
