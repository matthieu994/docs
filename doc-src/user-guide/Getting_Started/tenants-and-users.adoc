== Overview

After installing, configuring and activating the MSActivator, you will
start creating tenants and users. This guide will walk you through the
initial process of connecting and creating a tenant.

== Initial Connection

The MSActivator comes with one pre-created super admin user: ncroot (the
equivalent of the root user on Linux systems). The default password for
this user is "ubiqube".

This default password should be changed, especially if the MSActivator
is meant to be used in a production environment.

The default MSActivator portal address is
[.underline]#https://<MSA_IP>/UBI/en# (replace <MSA_IP> with the actual
IP address of your MSActivator installation.

== Tenancy Management

The MSActivator is design to provide multi-tenancy where a tenant is a
virtual private space that can be managed as an isolated environment.

There are 2 levels of tenancy, the Operator Tenant and the Customer
Tenant, the latest being nested in the Operator tenant.

=== Operator Tenant

Click on image:images/image2018-6-22_17-58-19.png[Icon,width=24] to open
the "Entity Creation" dialogue and select "Operator" as the Entity Type.

The "Prefix" is a 3 letter unique identifier for the tenant. It will be
combined with the Customer and Device ID to build a short,
comprehensive, unique identifier.

=== Customer Tenant

Click on image:images/image2018-6-22_17-58-29.png[Icon,width=24] to open
the "Entity Creation" dialogue and select "Customer" as the Entity Type.

Carefully select the Operator tenant where the Customer will be created.

In the "Contacts" form, the email is a mandatory field. This email will
be used to send Alarms. Alarm management is explained in the
link:../Assurance/alarm-management{outfilesuffix}[Alarm Management] guide.

Save the Customer form and navigate to the new Customer Tenant (click on
the Customer name in the customer list).
